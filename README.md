# twoStageGSA: Two Stage Gene Set Analysis

This is my attempt to implement
[“A Flexible Two Stage Procedure for Identifying Gene Sets that are Differentially Expressed” (Heller, et al. 2009)][1]
in R. At the moment the packages is not fully functional. Only what is
demonstrated in the vignette works.;
